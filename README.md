# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to gain insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival rates. Using various data analysis and machine learning techniques, we explore relationships between different features and predict survival probabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the Titanic dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes key trends and distributions in the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selects and transforms relevant features for predictive modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for survival prediction.
- **SHAP Analysis:** Utilizes SHAP values to interpret feature importance in model predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nqhthanh/Titanic_Analysis.git
   cd Titanic_Analysis
   ```

## 📊 Usage

1. **Prepare Data:** Ensure the Titanic dataset (CSV format) is available in the `data/` directory.
2. **Run Analysis:** Execute the Jupyter notebook or Python script to process and analyze the data:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook full.ipynb
   ```
3. **View Results:** Model performance, visualizations, and feature importance analysis will be displayed in the notebook.


## 🏗️ Future Improvements

- Enhance model accuracy with hyperparameter tuning.
- Implement deep learning-based survival prediction.
- Develop an interactive web-based dashboard for Titanic data exploration.
